# Introduction

<!-- TODO: Add SpatialData in intro -->
Spatial Transcriptomics data analysis involves several steps, including quality
controls (QC) and pre-processing, to ensure the reliability of downstream
analyses. This is an essential step in spatial transcriptomics to identify and
filter out spots and genes that may introduce noise and/or bias into the
analysis.

This report outlines the QC and pre-processing steps for Visium Spatial
Transcriptomics data using the [AnnData format](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/notebooks/getting-started.html)
and the [`scanpy` Python package](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
The anndata format is utilized to organize and store the Spatial Transcriptomics
data. It includes information about counts, features, observations, and
additional metadata. The anndata format ensures compatibility with various
analysis tools and facilitates seamless integration into existing workflows.

```{python}
#| tags: [parameters]
#| echo: false
input_sdata = "sdata_raw.zarr"  # Input: SpatialData file
min_counts = 500  # Min counts per spot
min_genes = 250  # Min genes per spot
min_spots = 1  # Min spots per gene
mito_threshold = 20  # Mitochondrial content threshold (%)
ribo_threshold = 0  # Ribosomal content threshold (%)
hb_threshold = 100  # content threshold (%)
artifact_dir = "artifacts"
output_adata = "adata_filtered.h5ad"  # Output: AnnData file
output_sdata = "sdata_filtered.zarr"  # Output: SpatialData file
```

from anndata import AnnData
from IPython.display import display, Markdown
from textwrap import dedent
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (6, 6)

```{python}
# Make sure we can use scanpy plots with the AnnData object exported from sdata.table
# This code is taken from the early version of https://github.com/scverse/spatialdata-io/pull/102/
# Once the PR will be merged in spatialdata-io, we should use spatialdata_io.to_legacy_anndata(sdata).
def to_legacy_anndata(sdata: spatialdata.SpatialData) -> AnnData:
    adata = sdata.table
    for dataset_id in adata.uns["spatial"]:
        adata.uns["spatial"][dataset_id]["images"] = {
            "hires": np.array(sdata.images[f"{dataset_id}_hires_image"]).transpose([1, 2, 0]),
            "lowres": np.array(sdata.images[f"{dataset_id}_lowres_image"]).transpose([1, 2, 0]),
        }
        adata.uns["spatial"][dataset_id]["scalefactors"] = {
            "tissue_hires_scalef": spatialdata.transformations.get_transformation(
                sdata.shapes[dataset_id], to_coordinate_system="downscaled_hires"
            ).scale[0],
            "tissue_lowres_scalef": spatialdata.transformations.get_transformation(
                sdata.shapes[dataset_id], to_coordinate_system="downscaled_lowres"
            ).scale[0],
            "spot_diameter_fullres": sdata.shapes[dataset_id]["radius"][0] * 2,
        }
    return adata
```

```{python}
# Read the data
sdata = spatialdata.read_zarr(input_sdata, ["images", "table", "shapes"])
adata = to_legacy_anndata(sdata)

# Convert X matrix from csr to csc dense matrix for output compatibility:
adata.X = scipy.sparse.csc_matrix(adata.X)

# Store the raw data so that it can be used for analyses from scratch if desired
adata.layers['raw'] = adata.X.copy()

# Print the anndata object for inspection
print("Content of the AnnData object:")
print(adata)
```

# Quality controls

There are several different quality metrics that are normally computed for
spatial data. Common metrics include the number of genes with a least 1 count
(`n_genes_by_counts`), counts per spot (`total_counts`) as well as the
percentage of counts from mitochondrial, ribosomal and haemoglobin genes
(`pct_counts_[mt/ribo/hb]`).

```{python}
# Calculate mitochondrial, ribosomal and haemoglobin percentages
adata.var['mt'] = adata.var_names.str.startswith('MT-')
adata.var['ribo'] = adata.var_names.str.contains(("^RP[LS]"))
adata.var['hb'] = adata.var_names.str.contains(("^HB[AB]"))
sc.pp.calculate_qc_metrics(adata, qc_vars=["mt", "ribo", "hb"],
    inplace=True, log1p=False)

# Save a copy of data as a restore-point if filtering results in 0 spots left
adata_before_filtering = adata.copy()
```

## Violin plots

The following violin plots show the distribution of the number of genes per
counts and counts per spot, as well as the percentage of counts from
mitochondrial, ribosomal and haemoglobin genes:

```{python}
#| layout-nrow: 2
sc.pl.violin(adata, ['n_genes_by_counts', 'total_counts'],
    multi_panel=True, jitter=0.4, rotation= 45)
sc.pl.violin(adata, ['pct_counts_mt', 'pct_counts_ribo', 'pct_counts_hb'],
    multi_panel=True, jitter=0.4, rotation= 45)
```

## Spatial distributions

The same quality metrics can also be plotted on top of the tissue so that
spatial patterns may be discerned:

```{python}
#| layout-nrow: 2
sc.pl.spatial(adata, color = ["total_counts", "n_genes_by_counts"], size=1.25)
sc.pl.spatial(adata, color = ["pct_counts_mt", "pct_counts_ribo", "pct_counts_hb"], size=1.25)
```

## Scatter plots

It is also useful to compare some of these quality metrics against each other in
scatter plots, such as mitochondrial versus ribosomal content and the total
counts versus the number of genes:

```{python}
#| layout-ncol: 2
sc.pl.scatter(adata, x='pct_counts_ribo', y='pct_counts_mt')
sc.pl.scatter(adata, x='total_counts', y='n_genes_by_counts')
```

## Top expressed genes

It can also be informative to see which genes are the most expressed in the
dataset; the following figure shows the top 20 most expressed genes.

```{python}
sc.pl.highest_expr_genes(adata, n_top=20)
```

# Filtering

## Non-tissue spots

The following plot indicates which spots are outside of the tissue. These spots
are uninformative and are thus removed.

```{python}
# Create a string observation "obs/in_tissue_str" with "In tissue" and "Outside tissue":
adata.obs["in_tissue_str"] = ["In tissue" if x == 1 else "Outside tissue" for x in adata.obs["in_tissue"]]

# Plot spots inside tissue
sc.pl.spatial(adata, color=["in_tissue_str"], title="Spots in tissue", size=1.25)
del adata.obs["in_tissue_str"]

# Remove spots outside tissue and print results
n_spots = adata.shape[0]
adata = adata[adata.obs["in_tissue"] == 1]
n_spots_in_tissue = adata.shape[0]
Markdown(f"""A total of `{n_spots_in_tissue}` spots are situated inside the
tissue, out of `{n_spots}` spots in total.""")
```

## Counts, genes and spots

We filter spots based on minimum counts and genes, but also filter genes based
on minimum spots; exactly what filtering criteria is reasonable is up to you and
your knowledge of the specific tissue at hand.

```{python}
#| warning: false
# Filter spots based on counts
n_spots = adata.shape[0]
n_genes = adata.shape[1]
sc.pp.filter_cells(adata, min_counts=min_counts)
n_spots_filtered_min_counts = adata.shape[0]

# Filter spots based on genes
sc.pp.filter_cells(adata, min_genes=min_genes)
n_spots_filtered_min_genes = adata.shape[0]

# Filter genes based on spots
sc.pp.filter_genes(adata, min_cells=min_spots)
n_genes_filtered_min_spots = adata.shape[1]

# Print results
Markdown(f"""
- Removed `{n_spots - n_spots_filtered_min_counts}` spots with less than `{min_counts}` total counts.
- Removed `{n_spots_filtered_min_counts - n_spots_filtered_min_genes}` spots with less than `{min_genes}` genes expressed.
- Removed `{n_genes - n_genes_filtered_min_spots}` genes expressed in less than `{min_spots}` spots.
""")
```

## Mito, ribo and Hb

We can also filter for mitochondrial, ribosomal and haemoglobin content of the
cells; exactly which filtering threshold should be used are, again, up to you
and your biological knowledge of the sample at hand. Please note that neither
ribosomal nor haemoglobin content is filtered by default.

```{python}
# Filter spots
adata = adata[adata.obs["pct_counts_mt"] <= mito_threshold]
n_spots_filtered_mito = adata.shape[0]
adata = adata[adata.obs["pct_counts_ribo"] >= ribo_threshold]
n_spots_filtered_ribo = adata.shape[0]
adata = adata[adata.obs["pct_counts_hb"] <= hb_threshold]
n_spots_filtered_hb = adata.shape[0]

# Print results
Markdown(f"""
- Removed `{adata.shape[0] - n_spots_filtered_mito}` spots with more than `{mito_threshold}%` mitochondrial content.
- Removed `{n_spots_filtered_mito - n_spots_filtered_ribo}` spots with less than `{ribo_threshold}%` ribosomal content.
- Removed `{n_spots_filtered_ribo - n_spots_filtered_hb}` spots with more than `{hb_threshold}%` haemoglobin content.
""")
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
# Restore non-filtered data if filtering results in 0 spots left
if (adata.shape[0] == 0 or adata.shape[1] == 0):
    adata = adata_before_filtering
    display(
        Markdown(dedent(
            """

            ## Issue: no spots remain after filtering

            An anomaly has been detected in the data: following the filtering
            process, all spots have been excluded. It is imperative to assess
            the data quality and carefully review the values of the filtering
            parameters.

            To ensure the smooth progression of downstream analysis, the
            exported AnnData will, for the time being, remain unfiltered. This
            precautionary measure is implemented to facilitate continued
            analysis while investigating and resolving the cause of the
            unexpected removal of all spots during filtering.

        ))
    )

## Filtering results

```{python}
# Print filtering results

The final results of all the filtering is as follows:
