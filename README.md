## Introduction

**nf-core/spatialvi** is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline for Visium spatial
transcriptomics data from 10x Genomics. It can process and analyse spatial data
either directly from raw data by running [Space Ranger](https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-space-ranger)
or data already processed by Space Ranger. The pipeline currently consists of
the following steps:

<p align="center">
    <img title="Spatialvi Workflow" src="docs/images/spatialvi_subway.png" width=60%>
</p>

0. Raw data processing with Space Ranger (optional)
1. Quality controls and filtering
2. Normalisation
3. Dimensionality reduction and clustering
4. Differential gene expression testing

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool
to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner.
It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results
highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html)
implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it
much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these
processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules)
in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within
the Nextflow community!

On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a
full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the
pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on
real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark
between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from
the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/spatialvi/results).

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

You can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/spatialvi \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/spatialvi/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/spatialvi/parameters).

## Pipeline output

To see the results of an example test run with a full size dataset refer to the [results](https://nf-co.re/spatialvi/results) tab on the nf-core website pipeline page.
For more details about the output files and reports, please refer to the
[output documentation](https://nf-co.re/spatialvi/output).

## Credits

nf-core/spatialvi was originally developed by the Jackson
Laboratory<sup>1</sup>, up to the [0.1.0](https://github.com/nf-core/spatialvi/releases/tag/0.1.0)
tag. It was further developed in a collaboration between the [National
Bioinformatics Infrastructure Sweden](https://nbis.se/) and [National Genomics
Infrastructure](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/) within [SciLifeLab](https://scilifelab.se/);
it is currently developed and maintained by [Erik Fasterius](https://github.com/fasterius)
and [Christophe Avenel](https://github.com/cavenel).

Many thanks to others who have helped out along the way too, especially [Gregor
Sturm](https://github.com/grst)!
