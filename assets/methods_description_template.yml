  <h4>Methods</h4>
  <p>Data was processed using nf-core/spatialtranscriptomics v${workflow.manifest.version} ${doi_text} of the nf-core collection of workflows (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x">Ewels <em>et al.</em>, 2020</a>), utilising reproducible software environments from the Bioconda (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-018-0046-7">Grüning <em>et al.</em>, 2018</a>) and Biocontainers (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx192">da Veiga Leprevost <em>et al.</em>, 2017</a>) projects.</p>
  <p>The pipeline was executed with Nextflow v${workflow.nextflow.version} (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3820">Di Tommaso <em>et al.</em>, 2017</a>) with the following command:</p>
  <pre><code>${workflow.commandLine}</code></pre>
